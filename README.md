# task2

## Clone project

```
git clone https://github.com/lipinski0wo/task2.git
```

### Move to project folder

```
cd task2
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Start project on localhost

```
npm run server
```

## There are still few things I would like to improve

- Animations
- Components extraction and separation
- Methods extraction
- Better backend handling, for example on dev I could use json-server module
- Better way to prepare data, it would simplyfy methods mentioned above
- Add lazy loading for images
