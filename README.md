## Customize configuration

There are still few things I would like to improve

- Animations
- Components extraction and separation
- Methods extraction
- Better backend handling, for example on dev I could use json-server module
- Better way to prepare data, it would simplyfy methods mentioned above
- Add lazy loading for images
